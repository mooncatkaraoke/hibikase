<hibikase.app> needs to already have been built using Qt Creator, or qmake +
make. You probably want a Release build, and you probably should do a clean
first to avoid packaging any unneccessary files. It will be modified in-place,
so make a copy first if you do not want this.

The result will be a hibikase.dmg file in the same directory. Any existing
hibikase.dmg will be deleted."
